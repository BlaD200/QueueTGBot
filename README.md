### Having troubles with managing queues in your group? Want to make queues maximum honest and objective? 
Well, this is the decision! I'm **QueueBot** and I'll help you to do all stuff related to queues and managing them.

First of all, give me the rights to **pin** the messages, 
so your group members will be **notified** when the queue will be created!
This will help them to be in touch and **don't miss** the new queues, they could want to participate in.

Done? Amazing!) To **create** a new queue send 
/create_queue <queue name> 
command. And don't forget to type the future queue's name.)👍 

Next step is to **become the participant** in the created queue.✅ To do this, 
just reply to the message, with the corresponding queue, with the /add_me command. 
(You can also leave the queue by sending /remove_me command) 

And the last important thing: when the time comes, **to move your queue further**, 
just reply to the queue with the /next command, and the next member _will be notified_, 
so no one will skip their turn!💪

So simple, yes?) Well, good luck, and _let there be only honest queues_.😎😎

My creator said that he will be very thankful for your feedback, 
any suggestions are welcomed and bug reports are priceless!
(If you encounter a problem, use the command /report to tell me about this.)
